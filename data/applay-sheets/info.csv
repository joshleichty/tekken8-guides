,,,,,,,,,,"
Can I download the file to make personal changes?
I want to avoid people uploading different versions of this file with similar
look than TK8's Library, to avoid confusion as to which is the original
So, for the time being, download is disabled

Could you include okizeme information?
The document is supposed to be a basic, so people can just pick a character up
have fun with them and later decide if they want to master them
Okizeme can be complicated and specific, so I don't plan to include
this information
